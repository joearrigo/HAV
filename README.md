# Hydro Assay Vehicle

This is the code that I developed during high school for the Hydro Assay Vehicle (HAV), an underwater ROV for montioring water quality. Its written in a mix of Python, Arduino, and Java (although my goal is to ultimately switch that to Python as well).

It relies on a Raspberry PI and two Arduinos for communication, thruster control, and sensor input respectively.
